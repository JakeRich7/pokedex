# Basic Pokedex

## Created to be tested! I'll be using playwright and cucumber to test this pokedex...

To get started locally: 
- run "git clone git@github.com:JakeRich7/pokedex.git"
- run "npm install"
- open index.html

To run tests:
- run "npx playwright test" to test all three major browsers
- run "npx playwright test --project=chromium" to just test Chromium
- run "npx playwright test --project=firefox" to just test Firefox
- run "npx playwright test --project=webkit" to just test Safari
